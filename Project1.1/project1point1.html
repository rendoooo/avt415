	<li class="listnumber"><h2>Rice Paper in Vietnamese Cuisine<h2>
		<h4>The web page will be about different types of rice paper and how the Vietnamese use it to make a variety of food and the history of how they are “invented”. Some examples would be rice paper salad, rice paper pizza (grilled rice paper), spring roll, etc. I chose this topic because I want to show more wonderful Vietnamese recipes with rice paper.</h4></li>
	<li class="listnumber"><h2>Sunset Rollercoaster</h2>
		<h4>Sunset Rollercoaster is an alternative rock band from Taiwan composed of six members. Their music is a combination of multiple genres such as soul, garage, psychedelic tock, synth-pop, etc. They are my recent favorite band, so I could dive deep into their history and talk more about some of their notable albums / EPs such as BOSSA NOVA, CASSA NOVA, JINJI KIKKO, VANILLA VILLA, and their recent collab album with HYUKOH (Korean band) called AAA.</h4></li>
	<li class="listnumber"><h2>Doraemon</h2>
		<h4>Doraemon is a manga and a long-runnning anime series started by Fujiko F. Fujio in 1969. The series is about a robot cat who came from the 22nd century travels back in time to help a kid called Nobi Nobita. I decided to choose this topic because I am familiar with the series and felt confident I am able to talk about the history of this series and also the impact of Doraemon on Asian children.</h4></li>
